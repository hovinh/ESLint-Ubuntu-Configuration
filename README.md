# ESLint-Ubuntu-Configuration
This repository contains configuration files to set up **ESLint** on **Ubuntu** to follow this [Style Guide](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~cs1101s/source/source_styleguide.pdf).

## PREREQUISITIES:
- node.js
- nvm
- git

## INSTRUCTION:

1) Open Terminal and direct to a folder on your local machine to download the repository: 
```console
$ git clone https://github.com/hovinh/ESLint-Ubuntu-Configuration
```
2) Run **init.sh** to set up ESLint:
```console
$ cd ESLint-Ubuntu-Configuration
$ chmod 755 init.sh execute.sh
$ ./init.sh
```
Expected outcome:
```console
Installed successfully!
```

3) Invoke **execute.sh** to run ESLint, for example `input_dir` is "/home/hoxuanvinh/assessment43" and `output_dir`is "/home/hoxuanvinh/output": 
```console
$ ./execute.sh "/home/hoxuanvinh/assessment43" "/home/hoxuanvinh/output"
```
Expected outcome, if testing on `assessment43` test cases containing 128 files,
```console
removed directory 'input'
Processed 128 files in total.
1 minutes and 57 seconds elapsed.
```

## PERFORMANCE:

## FAQ:
1) When invoking execute.sh file, why does it create a temporary `input` folder that contains copies of file in the actual `input_dir`?
    
    Answer: To invoke ESLint, we need 3 configuration files `package.json`, `package-lock.json` and `.eslintrc.js` to be stored in `input_dir` folder or its ancestor folders. For some reasons, if one copies these files into `input_dir`, we could not invoke ESLint, hence the workaround solution is copying the input files into `ESLint-Ubuntu-Configuration/input` and run ESLint from here.

2) How can I modify the currently implemented rule that ESLint is using?

    Answer: You can edit `.eslintrc.js` file. Further details of the rules could be found on ESLint's [website](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/).

3) Which test cases in `test` directory corresponding to each section in the Style Guide?

    Answer: You can easily point out by having a look at their name. For example, section **Indentation** in the Styde Guide has 2 test case files that are named `indentation_00_good.js` and `indentation_01_good.js`. `good` means we expect no error message, and vice versa for `bad`.

4) Which step should I follow to update a new version of ESLint?

    Answer:
    1) Update the rule in `.eslintrc.js` and (optional) additional test cases.
    2) Comment out the *line 38* in **init.sh**:
    ```console
    # rm $OUTPUT_FILE
    ```
    Run **init.sh**, check if the file ``test/output.txt`` contains the intended output, replace ``expected_output.txt`` with its content, then uncomment *line 38* again.

    3) Run **init.sh**, we expected output to look like this:
    ```console
    Installed successfully!
    ```
